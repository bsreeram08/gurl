Import from Postman. Run with environments. Assert on responses. Generate client code. All without leaving your shell.

**Gurl is not a curl wrapper.** It's a full API development environment — collections, environments, scripting, assertions, history, and multi-protocol support — built for the terminal. If Postman and httpie had a baby that grew up in a shell, this is it.

### Why not just use...?

- **httpie / xh** — beautiful one-shot requests. No persistence, no collections, no environments.
- **Hurl** — excellent for CI testing with `.hurl` files. No TUI, no scripting, no environments, HTTP only.
- **ATAC** — closest Postman-in-terminal experience. Rust TUI with collections. No JS scripting, no import from Postman, no codegen.
- **Slumber** — YAML-based TUI REST client with profiles. No scripting, no assertions, HTTP only.
- **Bruno CLI** — runs `.bru` collections. GUI needed for authoring. No interactive exploration.

## What it looks like

## Features

- **Named requests** — save any curl command with a memorable name, run it forever
- **Variable templates** — auto-detect IDs/UUIDs, substitute at runtime with `--var`
- **Environments** — swap base URLs, secrets, and tokens between dev/staging/prod
- **Import** — OpenAPI, Insomnia, Bruno, Postman, HAR
- **Auth handlers** — Basic, Bearer, API Key, Digest, OAuth 1/2, AWS SigV4, NTLM
- **Protocols** — HTTP, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, SSE
- **Scripting** — JavaScript pre/post-request hooks via goja runtime
- **Assertions** — assert on status, headers, body, and extracted variables (`extract:varName`)
- **Request chaining** - route follow-up requests with `setNextRequest`, `run-if`, and extracted variables
- **Collection runner** - data-driven testing with CSV/JSON input, dry runs, and assertion bail mode
- **Code generation** — generate curl, Go, Python, JavaScript from any saved request
- **Interactive TUI** — full bubbletea interface for browsing and running requests
- **Execution history** — per-request history + global timeline + diff between runs
- **Plugin system** — middleware, custom output formatters, commands, and auth handlers

```

### Pre-built Binaries

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bsreeram08/gurl/releases/latest):

tar -xzf gurl-linux-amd64.tar.gz && sudo mv gurl /usr/local/bin/gurl

# Linux (arm64)
curl -LO https://github.com/bsreeram08/gurl/releases/latest/download/gurl-linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf gurl-linux-arm64.tar.gz && sudo mv gurl /usr/local/bin/gurl
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsreeram08/gurl.git
cd gurl
go build -o gurl ./cmd/gurl
sudo mv gurl /usr/local/bin/
gurl --version
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Save a request
gurl save "health" https://api.example.com/health

# Save with full curl flags
gurl save "create-order" https://api.example.com/orders \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {{token}}" \
  -d '{"customer_id": "{{customerId}}"}'

# Or pipe a raw curl string
echo 'curl -X POST https://api.example.com/orders -d "{}"' | gurl save "create-order"

# Run it
gurl run "create-order" --var token=abc123 --var customerId=42

# List all saved requests
gurl list
```

## Real Workflows

### Migrate from Postman, keep your terminal

```bash
# Import your existing collection
gurl import postman ./my-collection.json

# Everything is here — names, auth, variables
gurl list
gurl run "Get Users" --env staging
```

### Test APIs with scripting and assertions

```bash
# Save extraction and scripts on a request
gurl save "login" https://api.example.com/auth/login \
  -X POST \
  --extract token=jsonpath:$.token \
  --post-script "gurl.setNextRequest('profile')"

# Run the chain, then persist extracted/script variables to the environment
gurl run "login" --env dev --chain --persist --assert "extract:token != ''"
```

### Save authentication with the request

```bash
# Discover the handlers and their parameters
gurl auth list
gurl auth info bearer

# Save a bearer token once, then run the request later
gurl save "profile" https://api.example.com/me \
  --auth bearer \
  --auth-param token='{{token}}'

gurl run "profile" --var token=abc123

# Basic auth and API keys work the same way
gurl save "admin" https://api.example.com/admin \
  --auth basic \
  --auth-param username='{{user}}' \
  --auth-param password='{{password}}'

gurl save "search" https://api.example.com/search \
  --auth apikey \
  --auth-param header=X-API-Key \
  --auth-param value='{{api_key}}'
```

Auth parameters use repeated `--auth-param key=value` flags. Saved auth settings are applied when you run the request, after variable templates are substituted.

### Run collections with data-driven inputs

```bash
# Run every request in a collection with CSV test data
gurl collection run "checkout-flow" --data ./test-data.csv --env staging

# Preview the flow without sending requests
gurl collection run "checkout-flow" --env staging --dry-run

# Stop only when an assertion fails
gurl collection run "checkout-flow" --env staging --assert-bail
```

### Compare responses over time

```bash
# See what changed between the last two runs
gurl diff "get-user"

# Or browse the full timeline
gurl timeline --pattern "get-*"
```

### Generate client code from saved requests

```bash
gurl codegen "create-order" --lang python
gurl codegen "create-order" --lang javascript
gurl codegen "create-order" --lang go
gurl codegen "create-order" --lang curl
```
